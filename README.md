# Vegeta Varload

This repository contains a variable rate load testing utility built on top of [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta). It is capable of delivering a dynamic load to an application under test by providing a set of implementations of the [`vegeta.Pacer`](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta/blob/master/lib/pacer.go) interface. Pacer implementations govern the load rate by determining when the next request should be sent -- allowing for the acceleration or deceleration of the request rate based on arbitrary logic.

### Pacers

There are currently two pacers provided:

* `step-function`: Models a load in which the load oscillates between target rates at specific durations. For example, you may deliver a load of 50 req/s for 10 seconds, followed by 150 req/s for 25 seconds, and so on. The acceleration and deceleration curve between rates is as aggressive as possible and the total test duration is defined by the sum of all step durations.
* `curve-fitting`: Models a load in which the load is described by a set of rates and a total duration of the test. The pacer will accelerate and decelerate between the data points to construct a load curve that is the best fit for the data points.

## Usage

```console
$ ./vegeta-varload --help
Usage of vegeta-varload:
  -duration duration
    	Duration of the test. Required when pacer is "curve-fitting"
  -file string
    	CSV file describing the pace
  -pacer string
    	Pacer to use for governing load rate [step-function, curve-fitting]
  -pacing string
    	String describing the pace
  -url string
    	The URL to attack (default "http://localhost:8080/")
```

## Example Output

```console
$ go run vegeta-varload.go --url https://www.opsani.com/ --pacer step-function --file attack.csv
