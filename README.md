# Vegeta Variable Load Testing

This repository contains an example of running a multi-rate load test using [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta)
as a library. This implements a variable load testing utility without any forking or modification of existing project code bases.

The utility will run an attack on a target URL (default of http://localhost:8080/) using the rate patterns defined in the `attack.csv` file.

This code was adapted from a 2017 article on Josh Barrats blog: https://serialized.net/2017/06/load-testing-with-vegeta-and-python/

## Example Output
