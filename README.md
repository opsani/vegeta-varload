# Vegeta Variable Load Testing

This repository contains an example of running a multi-rate load test using [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta)
as a library. This implements a variable load testing utility without any forking or modification of existing project code bases.

The utility will run an attack on a targetr URL (default of http://localhost:8080/) using the rate patterns defined in the `attack.csv` file.

This code was adapted from a 2017 article on Josh Barrats blog: https://serialized.net/2017/06/load-testing-with-vegeta-and-python/

## Building & Running on macOS

All the dependencies necessary to build are available via Homebrew.:

1. Install golang: `$ brew install golang`
2. Install Vegeta dependency: `$ go get -u github.com/tsenart/vegeta`
3. Build and run with Go: `$ go run vegeta_breaker.go`

## Running via Docker

A Dockerfile is provided that can be used to run the load test

```bash
$ docker build -t vegeta_varload .
$ docker run -ti vegeta_varload https://www.opsani.com/
```

## Running via Docker Compose

A Docker Compose assembly is provided that will run Nginx in one container and load test it with Vegeta Varload in another.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose logs -f vegeta
```

### Running ad-hoc load tests through Compose

```bash
$ docker-compose run vegeta https://www.opsani.com/
```
